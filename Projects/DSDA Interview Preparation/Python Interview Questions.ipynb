    "•\tPandas (use read_csv(..., chunksize=...))  \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tSample for Exploration  \n",
    "•\tWhy: You can examine a smaller, representative subset of data for quick analysis before working with the full dataset.  \n",
    "•\tPandas (e.g., df.sample(n=1000))  \n",
    "•\tSQL (TABLESAMPLE clause in some databases)  \n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tStore Data in a Database  \n",
    "•\tWhy: Databases efficiently handle large datasets and let you query only the parts you need.  \n",
    "•\tMySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite (Databases)  \n",
    "•\tSQLAlchemy or pandas read_sql_query (to connect Python/Pandas with databases)  \n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tUse Distributed Computing  \n",
    "•\tWhy: If your dataset is extremely large, chunking might still be too slow. A cluster of machines can split up the work.  \n",
    "•\tApache Spark (via PySpark) automatically distributes your data across a cluster and processes it in parallel.  \n",
    "•\tDask offers a more “Pandas-like” interface but still runs across multiple machines or cores.  \n",
    "•   Databricks: A managed platform that makes it easier to run Spark in the cloud without handling cluster setup yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tUse Efficient File Formats  \n",

    "•\tParquet, ORC  \n",
    "•\tpyarrow or fastparquet (for reading/writing parquet in Python)  \n",
    "\n",

    "•\tWhy: If data arrives continuously (like from sensors or a website), you process records on the fly instead of storing it all first.  \n",
